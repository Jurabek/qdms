# QDMS fork Roadmap

The purpose of this QDMS fork is to build a modular, open source, cross-platform financial data providing service.

Major components:

* real time data service
* historical data service
* storage of historical data

For the detailed plan take a look at the [milestones](https://github.com/leo90skk/qdms/milestones). There is still much to do, so the milestone plan could be not completed.   

## Fix Plans & ship dates

Out of the fact that there is still no strong community behind that project, we can not set up ship dates or fix planes for new feature, bug fixing etc.

Please reckon with the fact that you have to build features and fix bugs by you own.
Nevertheless I will encourage you to share your code on github and contribute to the project to make QDMS a better free open source "product", not just for your own benefits.
**Remember:** When you build a new feature and we implement it into the fork, the community can help you finding and solving bugs and even improve your feature.
